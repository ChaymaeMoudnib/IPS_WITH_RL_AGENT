# üõ°Ô∏è Network Intrusion Detection & Prevention System (IDPS) with Reinforcement Learning

A modern, hybrid Intrusion Detection and Prevention System that combines traditional Snort-style rule-based detection with Reinforcement Learning (RL) for adaptive, intelligent network security.  
Monitor, detect, and respond to threats in real time, with a user-friendly GUI and advanced alerting.


## ‚ú® Features

### Core Functionality
- **Real-time packet capture** (using Pcap4J)
- **Rule-based detection** (Snort rules, custom rules)
- **Reinforcement Learning agent** for adaptive threat response
- **Multi-threaded** processing for high performance
- **Comprehensive statistics**: protocol, traffic, alerts, RL accuracy

### Security & Detection
- Detects:  
  - XSS attacks  
  - SQL injection  
  - Port scans    
  - Custom Snort rules (ICMP, TCP, UDP, etc.)
- **Anomaly detection** (heuristics + RL)
- **Active/Passive blocking** (configurable)
- **Alert severity**: CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW

### GUI Highlights
- **Control Panel**: Start/stop capture, select interface, toggle RL
- **Simulation Panel**: Simulate XSS, SQLi, Port Scan, Snort rule tests
- **Packet Display**: Live packet info
- **Statistics Panel**: Traffic, RL stats, accuracy
- **Log Panel**: Alerts, events, exportable logs
- **RL Decisions Panel**: RL agent actions, confidence, learning

### Alerting & Logging
- **Visual alerts** in GUI (color-coded, icons)
- **Email notifications** for HIGH/CRITICAL alerts (configurable)
- **Persistent log files** (`logs/ids_YYYY-MM-DD.log`)
- **Export logs** for analysis

### Extensibility
- Add new rules in `rules/snort.rules`
- Plug in new RL models (`trained_model.rl`)
- Modular codebase for easy feature addition
